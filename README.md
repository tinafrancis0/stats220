# stats220

## This is my repo for STATS 220. 

### A little about me:

1. I am undertaking a degree in BSc Data Science
2. I am taking STATS 220 because it seems interesting and fun, also because its a course I am required to take
3. I am interested in learning about how to explore data and how to communicate effectively using data

### Other random things you *must* know:
* My love for coffee knows **no** limits
* I love dogs and cannot keep my hands to myself when I spot one
* If travelling were free, you'd never see me in the same place twice!
