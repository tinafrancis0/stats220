# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in BSc Data Science
- I am taking STATS 220 because it seems interesting and fun, also its course I am required to take
- I am interested in learning about how to explore data and how to communicate effectively using data
